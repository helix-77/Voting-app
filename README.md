# Voting App
The Voting App is a mobile application developed to explore and master React Native, Expo, Supabase, and NativeWind. It allows users to create, participate in, and manage polls in real-time. Leveraging Supabase for backend functionality, the app ensures seamless data synchronization and user authentication. Styled with NativeWind for a responsive and modern UI, this project serves as a hands-on learning experience in building scalable, cross-platform mobile applications with cutting-edge technologies.

## Tech-stack
- React Native
- Expo
- Supabase
- Nativewind

# To run the app
Simply install the apk from the [release](https://github.com/helix-77/Voting-app/releases) page. (update: Backend database has been disabled to save cost, released apk won't work anymore.)

Or, you can run it on Expo Go
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

# Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
